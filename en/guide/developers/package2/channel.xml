   Channels are new in PEAR 1.4.0.  Channels are a systemized way of differentiating between
   different download sources.  One such download source is pear.php.net, another is pecl.php.net,
   and there are several third party channels slowly springing up around the net.
  </para>
  <para>
   The &lt;channel&gt; tag should contain the full channel name, not any alias (don't use
   &quot;pear&quot;, use &quot;pear.php.net&quot;.
  </para>
  <para>
   A good rule of thumb to use when determining what channel name to use is &quot;where do
   I upload my releases to?&quot;  If the answer is pear.php.net, that is your package's channel.
   If the answer is pecl.php.net, then that is your channel.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you aren't running a channel server and wish to serve your packages as well as allow
   other packages to remotely depend on your package, the new uri-based package distribution
   method is the best choice, see the &lt;uri&gt; tag documentation link below.
