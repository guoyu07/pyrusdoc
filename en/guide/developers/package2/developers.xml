  <para>
   In package.xml 1.0, a developer was documented using the &lt;maintainer&gt; tag inside of
   a redundant &lt;maintainers&gt; container tag.  This has been simplified in package.xml 2.0
   both to slightly speed parsing and to make validation of the xml simpler.  Now, the contents
   of the &lt;role&gt; tag has been extracted as 4 tags to describe the maintainers of a package.
  </para>
  <para>
   In addition, a new internal tag &lt;active&gt; has been added, so that you can honor retired
   developers' work without having to remove them altogether from package.xml.
  </para>
  <para>
   <emphasis>WARNING:</emphasis> tag order is important.  List leads followed by developers followed
   by contributors and finally helpers.
