  <para>
   In package.xml 1.0, the version was simply the version.  package.xml 2.0
   splits the concept of versioning into two components, release and api.
  </para>
  <para>
   The release version is the same familiar versioning concept from package.xml 1.0.
   This version is validated very carefully by the packager.
  </para>
  <para>
   The API version is informational only - the installer does not use it.  It can be used for
   a package-time replacement by the installer.  This can be very useful when implementing a
   reflective method such as <function>getApiVersion</function>.  In addition, the API version
   is very loosely validated, and only requires a version_compare()-compatible version number.
