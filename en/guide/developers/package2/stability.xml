  <para>
   In package.xml 1.0, stability was known as &quot;state&quot; which is not the most
   accurate description.  package.xml 2.0 introduces the term stability and like version
   splits the concept of stability into two components, release and api.

  <para>
   The release stability is the same familiar state from package.xml 1.0.  It can be one
   of:
  </para>
  <para>
   <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      snapshot - a frozen picture of development at a particular moment
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      devel - a very new non-production release.  Devel should be used for extremely new,
      practically untested code.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      alpha - a new non-production release.  Alpha should be used for new code that
      has an unstable API or untested code.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      beta - a non-production release.  Beta should be used for code that has a stable API
      and is nearing a fully stable release.  Regresion tests and documentation should exist
      or soon follow to qualify as a beta release.  Release candidates should use the beta
      stability.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      stable - a production release.  Stable releases must have a stable API, and must have
      regression tests and documentation.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
  </para>
  <para>
   The API stability is informational only - the installer does not use it.
