 <para>
  The smallest unit that can be managed by Pyrus or the PEAR Installer is
  a <literal>package</literal>.  A package is a collection of files
  that are organized and defined by a meta-information file called
  <link linkend="guide.developers.package2.intro">package.xml</link>.
 </para>
 <para>
  A package also contains meta-information about the collected files, such
  as the name of the package, the <link linkend="guide.users.concepts.channel">channel</link>
  that the package is from, the version of the package, information
  on the developers who created the package, and any external dependencies the
  package has on other packages or installation requirements (such as minimum PHP version).
 </para>
 <para>
  Packages can exist as a collection of files on disk, or can be placed into
  an archive in phar, tar, or zip format and then later installed on another
  system.
