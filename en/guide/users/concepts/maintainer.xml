 <para>
  PEAR and PEAR2 calls its developers <literal>maintainers</literal>, and
  classifies maintainers by their level of contribution to a package, or
  their <literal>role</literal>.  In addition, each maintainer must choose a
  handle which can be used to refer
  to them in package.xml and in bug reports.  A handle is an alphanumeric
  word with all lower-cased letters such as <literal>cellog</literal>
  or <literal>tony2001</literal>.  If you are developing for pear.php.net,
  pear2.php.net or pecl.php.net, this handle is the account name you use
  to log into the website.
 </para>
 <para>
  Developer roles are <literal>lead</literal>, <literal>developer</literal>,
  <literal>contributor</literal> and <literal>helper</literal>.  Only lead
  maintainers have the permission to release a package.  Both lead and
  developer maintainers may create and modify package roadmaps, and
  all developers can directly log into pear.php.net and change the status of
  bugs for the packages that they maintain.
 </para>
 <para>
  For channels outside of pear.php.net, pecl.php.net, and pear2.php.net, these
  handles are still required, and have no special meaning beyond what the channel
  defines them to be.  However, both the Pyrus simple channel server and other
  external channel server implementations require the lead developer of a
  package to perform releases.
