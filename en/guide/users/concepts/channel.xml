 <para>
  A PEAR Channel is a web site that distributes
  <link linkend="guide.users.concepts.package">package</link> archives for remote
  installation by users of Pyrus or the PEAR Installer.  In addition to providing
  the package archives for download, a PEAR Channel must also provide some
  meta-information that the installer can use to locate the package releases and
  determine which is the best release to download.
 </para>
 <para>
  Channels have a file that defines the capabilities of the channel named channel.xml located in its
  document root (for instance,
  <link xlink:href="http://pear.php.net/channel.xml">pear.php.net's channel.xml</link>)
  and some meta-information in <link linkend="core.rest">REST</link> format.
 </para>
 <para>
  A channel can also provide a public frontend for users to browse the contents
  of the channel online, such as
  <link xlink:href="http://pear.php.net/packages.php">PEAR's public frontend</link>.
