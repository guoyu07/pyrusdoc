 <info><title>create - creates a PEAR channel</title></info>
 <para>
    The <literal>create</literal> command creates a PEAR channel on the
    local filesystem, including the channel.xml file and the get and rest
    directories. This command assumes you are currently at the web root
    for the channel you wish to create, unless you pass the path to where the
    channel.xml file will be created. The local root can be a subdirectory
    off of your webserver, but you should be in that subdirectory when
    executing this command.
