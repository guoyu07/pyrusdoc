   What is a PEAR Channel?  PEAR Channels make it possible to take advantage of
   the strengths of the PEAR Installer and Pyrus for your own personal packages.
   A channel is simply a website that provides packages for download and a few
   extra meta-information files.

  <para>
   A familiar example of a channel is
   <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://pear.php.net">pear.php.net</link>.
   This channel was the first channel, and defines the standards to which other
   channels must adhere.  Each channel has a channel.xml
   file in its document root (such as <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://pear.php.net/channel.xml">
   http://pear.php.net/channel.xml</link>) and a series of files utilizing the
   <literal>REST</literal> (Representational State Transfer) paradigm to describe
   the packages available for installation and download.  The <literal>pear.php.net</literal>
   channel's <literal>REST</literal> files can be viewed at <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://pear.php.net/rest">
   http://pear.php.net/rest</link>.
