   <literal>auto_discover</literal> is a flag (boolean), defaulting to
   <literal>0</literal> or off.  If on, this flag instructs Pyrus
   to automatically discover channels of dependencies (see
   <link linkend="pyrus.commands.channeldiscover">channel-discover</link> for
   a more in-depth description of what channel discovery means).
  </para>
  <para>
   For example, let's say we are installing Package <literal>foo</literal> from channel
   <literal>pear2.php.net</literal>, and that <literal>foo</literal> depends on package
   <literal>bar</literal> from channel <literal>pear.example.com</literal>.
   If Pyrus does not know the <literal>pear.example.com</literal> channel, and
   <literal>auto_discover</literal> is set to <literal>1</literal>, it will
   attempt to discover information on the channel, and after successfully
   adding its information to the registry, will then successfully download
   and install the dependency <literal>bar</literal>.  However, if
   <literal>auto_discover</literal> is disabled, Pyrus will simply fail
   with an error explaining that nothing is known about the
   <literal>pear.example.com</literal> channel, and that it must be
   added prior to installation.
