  <para>
   The <literal>openssl_cert</literal> configuration variable should be set to
   the full path to your personal PKCS#12 certificate, as signed by a recognized
   certificate authority such as <link xlink:href="http://www.cacert.org">CACert</link>.
   Pyrus uses this certificate along with your
   <link linkend="pyrus.configuration.user.handle">handle</link> to implement
   package signing.
  </para>
  <para>
   Your certificate must have the email address you use in package.xml as its
   alternate name, otherwise Pyrus will refuse to use it.  Pyrus uses the
   email address as stated in package.xml of the releasing maintainer of a
   package to verify that the package was actually created by the maintainer.
   This makes a man-in-the-middle attack far more difficult to execute, as well
   as verifying package integrity.
