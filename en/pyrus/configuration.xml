  <para>
   Pyrus has two kinds of configuration files, system configuration files, which
   are stored directly in the installation location, and user configuration files,
   which are stored in the home directory of the user, or in the Windows
   equivalent, <literal>My Documents</literal>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Each installation is tightly bound to the configuration that defines where
   files should be installed, which PHP executable to use, and which php.ini
   is used to manage that installation.
  </para>
  <para>
   On the other hand, user-specific preferences are tightly bound to each
   user, by placing them in the user's home directory.  These values are
   universal to all installations and include things like the amount of
   information to display, the preferred mirror to use for a channel, the
   openssl certificate to use for package signing, and so on.
  </para>
  <para>
   This way, multiple PEAR installations can be managed very safely without
   ambiguity over what configuration values should be used.
