 <section xml:id="pyrus.differences.frompear.overview">
  <info><title>Overview</title></info>
  <para>
   Pyrus is a re-factored version of the PEAR installer, re-designed for new features
   available in PHP 5.3 and newer.  As a result, Pyrus is more robust than PEAR
   as well as faster.  Several of the subtle design flaws in the PEAR Installer
   have been fixed, and so Pyrus is more stable than the PEAR Installer for
   handling an existing PEAR repository.
  </para>
  <para>
   Here is a brief summary of the differences from PEAR:
  </para>
  <section xml:id="pyrus.differences.frompear.overview.simpler">
   <title>Simpler to use than PEAR</title>
   <para>
    Pyrus is distributed as a single file, pyrus.phar.  Because of PHP's new
    phar extension, Pyrus does not need to be installed, and can run directly
    from the file pyrus.phar.
   </para>
   <para>
    Pyrus also simplifies the command-line options available, and provides a
    far greater range of developer tools for creating, managing and
    distributing packages through tools such as the simple channel server and
    package.xml creation command <literal>make</literal>.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="pyrus.differences.frompear.overview.secure">
   <title>More secure than PEAR</title>
   <para>
    Several security vulnerabilities in the design of PEAR were discovered due
    to the particular Command Pattern implementation used to detect file roles,
    commands, and other plugins.  Pyrus fixes this by requiring that all plugins
    be installed into a centralized location separate from the actual PEAR
    installation.  In addition, installation of plugins cannot happen at the same
    time as installation of packages, thus the enforced separation ensures a level
    of security that is much higher than PEAR supports, while preserving the
    flexibility that extending the installer provides.
   </para>
   <para>
    Pyrus also feaures true package signing and signature verification
    using OpenSSL PKCS#12 and X.509 certificates.  This allows users
    to directly verify the validity of a package, protecting from
    man-in-the-middle attacks and other potential disruptions of a package
    release.  This feature requires the openssl extension, which is not
    enabled by default.
   </para>
   <para>
    PEAR supports signing packages using PGP keys, but has no mechanism
    in place to verify the signed packages.  Pyrus will refuse to install
    a signed package without verifying the signature even if the openssl
    extension is not enabled.
   </para>
   <para>
    In addition, the new <link linkend="pyrus.configuration.user.paranoia">paranoia</link>
    setting can be used to control how upgrades are performed to releases that
    change the <link linkend="guide.users.concepts.api">API</link>, helping
    to guarantee safe upgrades to future releases.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="pyrus.differences.frompear.overview.smaller">
   <title>Smaller than PEAR</title>
   <para>
    Because Pyrus takes advantage of PHP 5.3's built in support for XML processing,
    archive handling, and advanced structures through the simplexml, libxml2,
    phar, sqlite3, and spl extensions, Pyrus is significantly smaller than PEAR, and
    as a result consumes far less memory to accomplish its tasks.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="pyrus.differences.frompear.overview.faster">
   <title>Faster than PEAR</title>
   <para>
    Pyrus is also faster than PEAR because of its reliance on built-in features
    of PHP 5.3 and a more structured object-oriented design.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="pyrus.differences.frompear.overview.robust">
   <title>More robust than PEAR</title>
   <para>
    Pyrus has redundant registries in XML and Sqlite3 database formats, as well
    as support for the existing PEAR registry.  Reconstruction of a corrupted
    registry is simple and fully supported.
   </para>
   <para>
    In addition, all installation tasks
    occur within an atomic transaction, including file installation and removal,
    so that if an installation or uninstall command fails mid-stream, or something
    as drastic as a power failure occurs, the PEAR installation will be not be
    left in a half-installed state.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="pyrus.differences.frompear.overview.flexible">
   <title>More flexible than PEAR</title>
   <para>
    Pyrus supports cascading installations, so that a system-wide installation
    of core packages can be recognized.  By default, include_path is used to
    detect PEAR installations, but a different location for a PEAR installation
    can be passed directly to Pyrus as its first argument.
   </para>
   <para>
    Convention over configuration allows packages constructed with the new PEAR2
    coding standards to be installed simply by extracting the archive, and then
    later upgraded using Pyrus without the intermediate step of using Pyrus to
    install the packages.  For the first time, this allows a try-before-you-buy
    approach to be possible.
   </para>
   <para>
    The same principle also makes bundling a PEAR2 package in another package's
    source repository possible, and Pyrus can be used to easily upgrade the
    package or revert to a previous version.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="pyrus.differences.frompear.overview.tested">
   <title>More tested than PEAR</title>
   <para>
    Pyrus has been developed with extensive unit testing and xdebug coverage
    data has been used to verify that the code is being executed.  As a result,
    the first alpha release of Pyrus has 10% higher code coverage than the most
    recent stable version of the PEAR Installer.
   </para>
  </section>
 </section>
 <section xml:id="pyrus.differences.frompear.configuration">
  <info><title>Configuration files</title></info>
  <para>
   One of the most important conceptual changes in Pyrus is how configuration
   is handled.  PEAR was designed to handle at most 2 installations by default,
   a system and a user PEAR installation, and it excels at this.  As soon as
   PEAR is used on multiple installations, a separate configuration file must
   be specified (as in <literal>pear -c /path/to/another/pear.conf install
   blah</literal>).  This leads to what is colloquially referred to as
   <quote>config hell</quote>, where it is easy to accidentally install
   things into the wrong place without realizing it.  Pyrus's configuration
   handling is specifically engineered to eliminate config hell, and to make
   handling multiple PEAR installations simple.
  </para>
  <para>
   PEAR stores all configuration values in a single configuration file, and allows
   specifying a different configuration file for different setups.  In addition,
   PEAR supports automatic cascade of a system configuration file and a user
   configuration file.  The configuration values are used when installing applications,
   and for customizing things like the path to php in the PEAR Installer's
   <literal>pear</literal> command.  Configuration files are stored separate
   from the PEAR installations that they represent.
  </para>
  <para>
   Pyrus instead splits up configuration files into two separate components: one
   file contains user customizations such as the preferred stability of packages
   to install, the username and password for logging into a channel, the verbose
   setting and so on.  Configuration variables that affect where to install files
   are stored in a separate configuration that is tightly bound to the PEAR
   installation.
  </para>
  <para>
   Thus, a PEAR configuration setup might look like:
  </para>
  <para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      System configuration in <literal>/etc/pear.conf</literal>, defines
      <literal>php_dir</literal> as <literal>/usr/local/lib/php</literal>
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      User configuration in <literal>/home/username/.pearrc</literal>, defines
      <literal>php_dir</literal> as <literal>/home/username/pear</literal>.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      <literal>include_path</literal> is set to <literal>/home/username/pear:/usr/local/lib/php</literal>.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>
  <para>
   The equivalent configuration setup with Pyrus would look like:
  </para>
  <para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      Pyrus-based installation in <literal>/usr/local/lib/pear</literal>, system configuration
      stored in <literal>/usr/local/pear/.config</literal> and php files in
      <literal>/usr/local/lib/pear/php</literal>.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      Another Pyrus-based installation in <literal>/home/username/pear</literal>, system
      configuration stored in <literal>/home/username/pear/.config</literal> and php
      files in <literal>/home/username/pear/php</literal>.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      User configuration in <literal>/home/username/.pear/pearconfig.xml</literal>.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      <literal>include_path</literal> is set to <literal>/home/username/pear:/usr/local/lib/pear/php</literal>.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>
  <para>
   By default, Pyrus uses the <literal>include_path</literal> to locate PEAR
   installations, but this is configurable with the new user configuration
   variable <literal>my_pear_path</literal>, which is a <constant>PATH_SEPARATOR</constant>
   separated list of paths to PEAR installations.
  </para>
  <para>
   In addition, an explicit path can be directly passed to Pyrus:
  </para>
  <para>
   <literal>php pyrus.phar /home/username/pear:/usr/local/lib/pear list-packages</literal>
  </para>
  <para>
   The above command will list the installed packages in both registries in
   <literal>/home/username/pear</literal> and in <literal>/usr/local/lib/pear/php</literal>.
  </para>
  <para>
   A detailed reference of Pyrus's handling of configuration files is
   <link linkend="pyrus.configuration">here</link>
  </para>
 </section>
 <section xml:id="pyrus.differences.frompear.registry">
  <info><title>Registries</title></info>
  <para>
   Pyrus fully supports PEAR's registry format, but introduces 2 new registry formats,
   an sqlite3 database-based registry, and an XML file-based registry.  These
   registries are fully redundant, and can be used to repair or reconstruct a corrupt
   registry.
  </para>
  <para>
   In addition, unlike PEAR, which stores the registry in the same directory as
   the PHP source files, Pyrus stores the registry in its parent directory.
   Thus, PHP files stored in <literal>/usr/local/lib/php</literal> have their
   registry in <literal>/usr/local/lib</literal>.
  </para>
  <note>
   <simpara>
    For backwards compatibility, an older PEAR registry is always
    stored in the location the PEAR Installer expects it to be stored.
   </simpara>
  </note>
  <para>
   Pyrus is intelligent enough to detect which registries are present, and
   to use them.  If only an older PEAR registry exists, Pyrus will not
   automatically upgrade to the newer format.  However, the
   <literal>upgrade-registries</literal> command is available to convert from
   an older registry to the newer format.
  </para>
  <para>
   Some of the benefits of the newer registry format include much speedier
   processing of a large registry at installation time due to Sqlite3's
   speedy processing.  Additionally, truly safe uninstall-time resolution of
   dependencies is possible, something that PEAR can only do for relatively
   simple package dependency trees.
  </para>
  <para>
   In addition, the XML registry consists of storing the package.xml and
   channel.xml files for package releases in the same location that they
   are packaged.  This is what makes it possible to extract a package
   created with Pyrus and then later use Pyrus to upgrade it.
  </para>
  <para>
   For instance, the hypothetical <literal>PEAR2_Foo</literal> package from
   channel <literal>pear2.php.net</literal> version <literal>1.2.3</literal>
   will store its package.xml in path
   <literal>.xmlregistry/packages/pear2.php.net/PEAR2_Foo/1.2.3-package.xml</literal>
   inside the archive, so that when it is extracted, it lines up exactly with how
   the package would look on disk when installed with the XML registry.
  </para>
 </section>
 <section xml:id="pyrus.differences.frompear.packagexml">
  <info><title>package.xml changes</title></info>
  <para>
   Pyrus no longer supports
   <link linkend="developers.packagedef.intro">package.xml version 1.0</link>,
   although it will include a package.xml version 1.0 in an archive designed
   to support both earlier PEAR versions and the more recent versions.  It does
   not validate the package.xml, however, and so it is important to validate
   any older package.xml format using PEAR and not Pyrus.
  </para>
  <para>
   In addition, Pyrus has introduced support for PEAR2 packages that can
   be extracted to disk and then later upgraded using Pyrus.  To implement
   this feature, Pyrus transforms paths in a different way from PEAR.
  </para>
  <para>
   For example, this entry from a package.xml:
  </para>
  <para>
   <programlisting role="xml">
    <![CDATA[
   <dir name="php" baseinstalldir="PEAR2">
    <dir name="Pyrus">
     <dir name="Developer">
      <dir name="CoverageAnalyzer">
       <dir name="SourceFile">
        <file role="php" name="PerTest.php"/>
       </dir>
      </dir>
     </dir>
    </dir>
   </dir>
    ]]>
   </programlisting>
  </para>
  <para>
   would cause PEAR to install <literal>PerTest.php</literal> into the
   relative path <literal>PEAR2/php/Pyrus/Developer/CoverageAnalyzer/SourceFile/PerTest.php</literal>.
   Pyrus, however, recognizes that <literal>php</literal> is actually the default value of
   the <link linkend="pyrus.configuration.system.phpdir">php_dir</link> system
   configuration variable, and strips it from the path, resulting in
   <literal>PerTest.php</literal> being installed into the path:
   <literal>PEAR2/Pyrus/Developer/CoverageAnalyzer/SourceFile/PerTest.php</literal>.
  </para>
  <para>
   To enable this handling, one need only set the &lt;pearinstaller&gt;
   dependency to version <literal>2.0.0a1</literal> or newer.  Pyrus will
   automatically recognize any package.xml with a &lt;pearinstaller&gt;
   dependency on any version of the PEAR Installer as an older package.xml, and
   will not perform the magic removal of configuration values from
   directories.
  </para>
  <para>
   No other changes have been made to package.xml handling, except that the
   default version of package.xml used when generating a package.xml is
   version 2.1, which has been supported by the PEAR Installer since
   version <literal>1.5.0</literal>.
  </para>
 </section>
 <section xml:id="pyrus.differences.frompear.plugins">
  <info><title>Extending Pyrus: plugins</title></info>
  <para>
   The PEAR Installer allowed packages to install custom commands as well as
   custom file roles and custom file tasks that are used in package.xml.  Pyrus
   also allows this, but the format of plugins is very different.  If you are
   simply a user of PEAR, you probably won't notice the difference, except that
   some packages that use custom file roles or tasks will not be installable by
   Pyrus until the maintainer releases an update that will work with both PEAR
   and Pyrus.
  </para>
  <para>
   PEAR extensions are installed directly into the location where the PEAR
   installer is located.  Thus, if PEAR is located in
   <literal>/usr/local/lib/php/PEAR</literal>, a custom command must install
   its XML information file and PHP script into
   <literal>/usr/local/lib/php/PEAR/Command</literal>,
   a custom file role must install its XML information file and PHP script into
   <literal>/usr/local/lib/php/PEAR/Installer/Role</literal> and a custom file
   task must install its PHP script into
   <literal>/usr/local/lib/php/PEAR/Task</literal>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Pyrus is distributed as a phar archive, so this model is no longer physically
   possible, one cannot just magically insert files into the phar archive without
   considerable pain and annoyance (the phar.readonly INI setting must be disabled
   by hand).  Instead, Pyrus installs all plugins into a location specified
   by the new <literal>plugins_dir</literal> user configuration variable.
   By default, this installs plugins into <literal>$HOME/.pear/plugins</literal>
   on unix systems, and <literal>My Documents\pear\plugins</literal> on Windows.
  </para>
  <para>
   All plugins to Pyrus now must provide an xml file with one of the three
   new file roles <literal>customcommand</literal>, <literal>customrole</literal>
   or <literal>customtask</literal> in package.xml.  Pyrus uses the information
   in the XML file to locate the PHP script that will execute the plugin.  In
   addition, only one plugin is allowed per package, and the first one Pyrus
   encounters is the one that will be used.  More information on custom plugins
   is provided in the <link linkend="pyrus.plugins">Pyrus plugins</link> section
   of the manual.
  </para>
  <para>
   For developers of existing PEAR custom roles/tasks and post-install scripts,
   a special kind of file role that allows configuration of your package after
   installation, making your work compatible with Pyrus can be accomplished.

  <info><title>Installing and Building PECL extensions</title></info>
  <para>
   PEAR's handling of PECL extensions has been somewhat dodgy, with reports of
   issues with phpize failing, and other problems.
   Pyrus attempts to fix this through two major changes to the way PECL packages
   are built and installed.
  </para>
  <para>
   <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      PECL packages are installed into a new location <literal>src/</literal>

    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      The same tool process used to build extensions by hand is used verbatim
      by pyrus to build the extension
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
  </para>
  <section>
   <title>PECL installation changes</title>
   <para>
    PEAR builds PECL packages by creating a temporary directory, installing all of
    the source files into this directory, building the extension, harvesting
    built files, and finally removes the temporary directory.  This system works
    most of the time, but if there is a problem, it is impossible to debug because
    the sources are removed.
   </para>
   <para>
    Pyrus solves this by splitting PECL package installation into two components,
    installation and build.  The installation process simply places the
    source files into a sub-directory of the <literal>src_dir</literal> configuration
    variable, and thus makes it possible to debug problems or even apply patches
    to the source and re-build.
   </para>
   <para>
    In addition, because installation is separate from the actual building, PECL
    packages can now implement post-install scripts to handle truly complex
    configuration of extensions beyond what configure options can handle.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>PECL build</title>
   <para>
    The new <literal>build</literal> command enhances PEAR's package building by
    directly calling this sequence:
   </para>
   <para>
    <screen>
     <![CDATA[
phpize --clean
phpize
./configure [any options specified by <configureoptions>]
make
make install
     ]]>
    </screen>
   </para>
   <para>
    This is the same sequence one would use to build a PECL extension by hand.
    In addition, <function>proc_open</function> is used instead of
    <function>popen</function>, which allows better monitoring and control of
    the processes in question.
   </para>
   <para>
    Lastly, Pyrus is more cross-platform than PEAR, as it replaces a
    call to <literal>find</literal> and <literal>xargs</literal> with native
    PHP iteration over the modules directory when listing extension components
    that were built.
