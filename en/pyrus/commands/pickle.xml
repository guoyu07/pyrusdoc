  <para>
   The pickle command is designed to make the creation of an extension for
   <acronym>PECL</acronym> developers very easy.  It scans a SVN checkout
   of a PECL package directory, generates package.xml, and packages a
   release in one step.
  </para>
  <para>
   The pickle command looks for these standard files:

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><simpara>CREDITS</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>README</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>RELEASE-X.Y.Z (where X.Y.Z is the release version)</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>API-X.Y.Z (where X.Y.Z is the API version)</simpara></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>

   and for a standard directory layout of

<screen>
/                Extension source files
data/            Data files
tests/           Test files
doc/             Documentation files
examples/        Example files (documentation)
</screen>

   The CREDITS file must have this format for the pickle command to recognize it:

<screen>
 <![CDATA[
;; extensionname
Maintainer One [handle1] <email@example.com> (role)
Maintainer Two [handle2] <email@example.com> (role)
 ]]>
</screen>

   Where role is one of lead, developer, contributor, helper.

   The first line of README is used as the summary of the package.
   RELEASE-X.Y.Z is used as the release notes.
  </para>
  <para>
   <literal>X.Y.Z</literal> in the filename <literal>RELEASE-X.Y.Z</literal> is
   also used to automatically calculate the stability, and
   <literal>X.Y.Z</literal> in the filename <literal>API-X.Y.Z</literal> is used
   to calculate the API stability.  The formula is relatively simple: if X is
   <literal>0</literal>, the stability is set to <literal>alpha</literal>.
   Otherwise, if X is <literal>1</literal> or greater, the following methods are
   used to calculate the stability.
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      If Z contains <literal>a</literal> as in the version <literal>1.0.0a1</literal>
      the stability is set to <literal>alpha</literal>
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      If Z contains <literal>b</literal> as in the version <literal>1.0.0b1</literal>
      the stability is set to <literal>beta</literal>
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      If Z contains <literal>RC</literal> as in the version <literal>1.0.0RC1</literal>
      the stability is set to <literal>beta</literal>
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Otherwise, stability is set to <literal>stable</literal>.

 <section xml:id="pyrus.commands.pickle.args">
  <title>Arguments to the pickle command</title>
  <para>
   The pickle command has 4 arguments:
   <screen>php pyrus.phar pickle extname channelname /path/to/packagedir extensions...</screen>
  </para>
  <para>
   <literal>/path/to/packagedir</literal> specifies the location in which to
   package up the release.  If not present, it defaults to the current working
   directory.  The pickle command usually should be executed from that directory,
   this argument is present to allow batch creation of package.xml files for
   multiple extensions with a single shell script.
  </para>
  <para>
   If <literal>package.xml</literal> does not exist in the location packaging
   will take place, then the first argument is required.  The first argument
   is the name of the package, which is usually the same name as the extension,
   and the second argument is the channel name.  If not specified, the package
   is assumed to be in the <literal>pecl.php.net</literal> channel.
  </para>
  <para>
   The final argument, <literal>extensions</literal> is a list of file extensions
   that should be considered source files.  By default, the file extensions
   recognized as source files are:

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><simpara>c</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>cc</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>h</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>m4</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>w32</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>re</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>y</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>l</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>frag</simpara></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>
 </section>
 <section xml:id="pyrus.commands.pickle.donotpackage">
  <title>--donotpackage</title>
  <para>
   If <literal>--donotpackage</literal> or <literal>-n</literal> is specified,
   then the pickle command will only generate package.xml, and will not
   package up a release.  The <link linkend="pyrus.commands.package">package</link>
   command can be used to build the release after reviewing package.xml.
