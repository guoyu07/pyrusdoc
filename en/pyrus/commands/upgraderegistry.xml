  <para>
   The upgrade-registry command is used to convert a registry from the old
   PEAR Installer format into the new Pyrus format, and then optionally
   remove the old registry.
  </para>
  <para>
   The command creates registries in Sqlite3 and XML formats in the path passed
   as the argument to <literal>upgrade-registry</literal>.  Note that Pyrus
   registries are stored in the parent directory as the installed PHP files,
   whereas PEAR registries are stored in the same directory as the installed
   PHP files, so it is necessary for Pyrus to have write access to the parent
   directory.

  <para>
   The <literal>--removeold</literal> or <literal>-r</literal> option instructs
   Pyrus to remove the old PEAR registry when finished upgrading.
