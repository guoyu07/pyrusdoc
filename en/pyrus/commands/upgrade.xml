  <para>
   The upgrade command is almost identical to the <link linkend="pyrus.commands.install">install</link>
   command.  The only difference is that upgrade will also upgrade an existing package
   as well as install a new one.

  <para>
   The <literal>--packagingroot</literal> option is also unavailable,
   <literal>--packagingroot</literal>
   should only be used for installing new files.
