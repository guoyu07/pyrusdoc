  <para>
   The <literal>mypear</literal> command sets up the path or paths in which Pyrus
   will look for installed packages.  If multiple paths are specified, they
   should be separated by <constant>PATH_SEPARATOR</constant>, which is
   <literal>:</literal> on unix systems, and <literal>;</literal> on Windows-based
   systems.  If multiple paths are specified, only the first path will be
   used for installing packages.  The other paths are only used to validate
   package dependencies.

  <para>
   <literal>mypear</literal> is a convenient alternative to using the
   <link linkend="pyrus.commands.set"><literal>set</literal></link> command to
   set the <literal>my_pear_path</literal> configuration variable.
