  <para>
   This command lists all packages that have upgrades available within the
   current <literal>preferred_state</literal> or the installed package's stability,
   whichever is less stable.  This command does not list releases that are
   incompatible with the current PHP version.
  </para>
  <para>
   If package <literal>X</literal> is installed with version <literal>0.3.0</literal>,
   stability <literal>alpha</literal>, and <literal>preferred_state</literal>
   is <literal>stable</literal>, Pyrus will list the newest version available
   that satisfies stability of <literal>alpha</literal>, <literal>beta</literal>
   or <literal>stable</literal>.  If package <literal>Y</literal> is also
   installed, with version <literal>1.2.3</literal>, stability <literal>stable</literal>,
   only the latest stable release will be listed.  In both cases, if the latest
   available version that satisfies these requirements is not found, none will
   be listed.
  </para>
  <para>
   Another example: If package <literal>X</literal> is installed with version
   <literal>1.0.0</literal>, stability <literal>stable</literal>, and the
   <literal>preferred_state</literal> is <literal>alpha</literal>, Pyrus
   will list the newest version available
   that satisfies stability of <literal>alpha</literal>, <literal>beta</literal>
   or <literal>stable</literal>.
