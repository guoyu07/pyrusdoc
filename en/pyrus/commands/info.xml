  <para>
   This command is used to display a list of information on a package,
   such as the maintainers, the stability and version or versions available
   for installation (for remote packages).
  </para>
  <para>
   If passed <literal>description</literal> or <literal>notes</literal>,
   it displays the complete text of these fields.  If passed <literal>files</literal>,
   it lists the files in the package and their on-disk location for installed
   packages.  For example:
  </para>
  <para>
   <screen>php pyrus.phar info PackageName description</screen>
  </para>
  <para>
   The command will accept any concrete or
   <link linkend="guide.users.concepts.abstractpackage">abstract</link> package
   names as its argument.  Note that if there is an ambiguity between an installed
   package and the remote package, Pyrus will assume that information is being
   requested on the installed package.
  </para>
 </section>
 <section xml:id="pyrus.commands.info.forceremote">
  <title>--forceremote</title>
  <para>
   The <literal>--forceremote</literal> or <literal>-r</literal> option is used
   to instruct Pyrus to resolve any ambiguity between an installed package and
   a remote package to assume that information is requested on the remote package.
