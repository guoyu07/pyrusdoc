 <para>
  <classname>PEAR_ErrorStack</classname> is an experimental error raising and handling implementation for PEAR that is designed
  to replace PEAR_Error when it has stabilized.  PEAR_ErrorStack is both backwards compatible with <classname>PEAR_Error</classname>
  and forward compatible with PHP 5's <classname>PEAR_Exception</classname> class.  There are many other features, all described
  in the Introduction.
