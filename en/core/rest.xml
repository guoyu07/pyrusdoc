 <!-- FIXME: faq
- how do I find the latest version of a package? (incl. stable/beta/..)
- where do I get the download URL from?
- URL calculation
- can a package have multiple categories?

<bbieber> cweiske: the only thing I can think of off-hand is omission of the /get/ directories - and including both .tar/.tgz (are both necessary anymore?)
<cweiske> i think they are
<cweiske> since you need to decide if you can work with compression or not
<cweiske> if you got no gzip lib, you need the tar only
<cweiske> otherwise you can save bandwith and load the gz
<bbieber> slide 16 has some info on the archive file... which could have the info.
<bbieber> cweiske: ah yes.
<cweiske> btw, I found no docs where the /get/ dirs are located
<cweiske> they are referenced in the package xyz info
<cweiske> but nothing more
